  		<h1>Who Are We?</h1>
  		<p>We are a group based in New York City, working towards making NYC a safer place.</p>
      <br><br>
  		<h1>Our Mission:</h1>
  		<p>We are specifically aiming to make the NYC subway system safer as it is the primary method of transportation for many New Yorkers.</p>
  		<p>This site allows users to find a "buddy" to travel with when they are traveling alone. In fact, users can find more than one buddy and form a group should they feel truly unsafe even with 1 other person.</p>
  		<p>Currently, this service is limited to only a few stations and trains at this time. We will continue to further develop this site so that all New Yorkers can utilize this system.</p>
